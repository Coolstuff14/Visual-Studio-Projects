# Visual Studio Projects
This is an assortment of visual studio projects mostly done in high school, although some are newer quick projects I've done. I have deemed these not important enough for individual repositories. Projects are separated by the visual studio version they were made in. Almost all projects here are written in Visual Basic.

Project Descriptions
-------
***Warning many of these programs are very dumb and a result of high school shenanigans*

**VS 2008:**

 - **Christmas App:** This is a program that plays Christmas music stations and has a customization image that can sit on your screen, giving your desktop some Christmas spirit.
 - **Desktop Haunt:** This program allows you to set a popup image that once clicked disappears and reappears on a set time.
 - **Email Nuker & Email Sender:** These two programs are basically the same with the exception of design and Email Sender being more complex. So whats it do? Its an email spammer, because why not.
 - **EyeSpy:** This is a very basic key logger (Yes, this allowed me to prank a friend)
 - **File Renamer:** This is a relatively newer program and one that has some utility. This will rename all files in a folder with a scheme you select, handy for wallpaper folders.
 - **More Foam:** This is a result of doing it for the lulzz. This is a game based off a skit from a kids TV show, Big Time Rush, where a coffee machine Cal tries to take over the world and you need to stop it.
 - **Password Generator:** As boring as the name suggests.
 - **Print:** Want to easily print 9001 blank or solid black pages?? Well now you can! This may have gotten me in trouble at some point, use at your own risk.
 - **RS Autotalker:** This is a very basic Runescape auto chat bot.
 - **Sync Chat 4.0:** This was a request from a friend. Its a chat room based off a text file in a shared or network location.
 - **System Tray Shortcuts:** Want to have custom shortcuts accessible from your system tray?? Well now you can! Just select a folder and place shortcuts inside, now you can right click the icon and select one.
 - **iPhone:** A (very bad) virtual iPhone

**VS 2010:**

 - **Plant Timer:** Allows you to set a plant water timer for an X10 module (Requires X10 CM15A)3
 - **Temp Party Button:** A program to that is the brain behind my party button. Press a button and it turns on numerous X10 modules and runs programs.

**VS 2013:**

 - **2Display:** Allows control of a serially connected RedLion large Display Counter (Model LD2006P0 or LD4006P0)
 - **Da Wifi:** Creates a WiFi network (Only some card support)
 - **Door Monitor:** Overlay a security camera feed on your monitor.
 - **ClockToDisplay:** This is a a windows service that displays the time to a RedLion large Display Counter (Model LD2006P0 or LD4006P0)
