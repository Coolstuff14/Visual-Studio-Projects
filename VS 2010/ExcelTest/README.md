# Excel Test?? 

This was a quick program put together to assist in a research project I was helping with. The projects goal was to use three microphones placed in a triangle, to triangulate the direction of a sound. Sound data was stored in a CSV format and we were examining the audio waves. This program cut down the time it took to graph and export the three audio waves. While making this I had to create a python script to generate three sound waves and save them in a CSV format. *Must have Excel installed to run.
